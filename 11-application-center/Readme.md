## IBM Application Center

[Application Center](https://mobilefirstplatform.ibmcloud.com/tutorials/en/foundation/8.0/appcenter/) can be used as an Enterprise application store and is a means of sharing information among different team members within a company.

The concept of Application Center is similar to the concept of the Apple public App Store or the Android Market, except that it targets only private usage within a company.

By using Application Center, users from the same company or organization download applications to mobile phones or tablets from a single place that serves as a repository of mobile applications.
